# Change log

Simple Stack 0.1.1 (2017-01-14)
---------------------------------
- Key and backstack are now provided to custom viewgroup via `getSystemService()`

Simple Stack 0.1.0 (2017-01-13)
---------------------------------
- Added initial `Backstack`, `StateChange` and `StateChanger` classes.
- Backstack allows manipulation of state via `goTo()`, `goBack()` and `setHistory()`.
- Demo persists backstack history through config change and process death.

Limitations:
- ViewState is not persisted
- scheduling state changes (starting a state change while another is in progress) is not allowed
- there is a possibility that state change can occur even after `onPause()`
- key and backstack are manually set to the custom viewgroup, which means these are not directly accessible in their child views (and the interfaces are ugly anyways)
